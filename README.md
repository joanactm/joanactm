- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @joanactm
- ðŸ‘€ I first discovered and got to know programming in highschool, where I had a programming class and fell in love with it. Stopped for a few years, missed it and decided to come back, with the intention of furthering my knowledge and hopefully getting a job in the business, mainly (currently) in front-end/web developing.
- ðŸŒ± I know HTML and CSS and I'm currently learning JavaScript
- ðŸ—º Iâ€™m looking to learn and connect with other developers.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
